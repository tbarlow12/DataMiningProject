# NBA-Positional-Clustering
Clustering NBA statistical data to identify position of player

Player positions in the NBA have become a rather fluid concept. Teams like the Warriors with their "Lineup of Death" have shaken the traditional mindset of the basketball world.

We wanted to be able to build out a clustering model that used a player's statistics to identify the player's "true position." 

When we say "true position," we mean the position the player plays most alike. While LeBron James could be listed at just about any position on the floor, we wanted to know what his stats told us.

By creating an unsupervised clustering model, players would be grouped together with other players of a similar statistical model.
